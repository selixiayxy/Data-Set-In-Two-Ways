I still When I think of all the things my mother said When I think of all the feelings I hid from her Oh, in many, many ways, I'm still a young boy Waiting patiently for 4 p.m. But I loved her with my last breath And I loved her with a love that was strong as death And I loved her when she was unkind And I loved her I loved her a dangerous mind Sometimes when I look up at the sky She leads me on she still leads me on Sometimes when I stare up at the ceiling She leads me on she still leads me on I wonder if her touch will ever fade Is she waiting in the garden for us to play Yes in many many ways I'm still a young boy With all those questions in my petrol-blue eye But I loved her with my last breath And I loved her with a love that was strong as death And I loved her when she was unkind And I loved herI loved her with a dangerous mind Sometimes when I look up at the sky She leads me on she still leads me on Sometimes oh when I just feel like screaming She leads me on she still leads me on Sometimes when I don't know what is mine She leads me on she still leads me on Sometimes when I can't control my feelings She leads me on she still leads me on One two Sometimes when I look up at the sky She leads me on she still leads me on"
